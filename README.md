AI Research Assistant (Spring Boot + Google Gemini) Browser Extension

This project is a backend service built using Spring Boot that integrates with Google Gemini via its HTTP API.

The goal of this project is to understand how AI models can be consumed directly through REST APIs and wrapped inside a clean backend service, without relying on high-level AI frameworks.
